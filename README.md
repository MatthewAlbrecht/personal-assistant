# Personal Assistant Application

## What is this?

This is an app that is meant to help organize my life, features include:

- [People Database](https://sive.rs/dbt): inspired by Derek Sivers. A place to store data on the different people in my life and help automate things like _remembering to reach out to them_ (I'm notoriously bad at this)
- Semi-regular tasks: Things like deep cleaning the kitchen, Weekly & monthly reflections
- Maybe some other stuff too (almost definitely)

## What is this made with?

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.
